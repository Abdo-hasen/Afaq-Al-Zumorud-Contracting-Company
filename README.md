## 🧩 Technical Challenges & Solutions

### 1. Unified User Table for Travelers & Guides

**Challenge:** The platform has two user types — travelers and guides — that share most of their data (name, phone, wallet, bookings). Creating a separate table and guard for each would mean duplicated migrations, duplicated auth logic, and unnecessary complexity.

**Solution:** Both types live in a single `users` table with a dedicated `**role`** column backed by a PHP enum (`traveler` / `guide`). The same `User` model and Sanctum guard serve both apps; controllers and services branch behavior from that enum.

---

### 2. Three-Phase Traveler Booking Flow

**Challenge:** A booking is not a single “submit form” action. The traveler must discover who is available, understand pricing and rules before paying, and only then lock a reservation — without creating half-valid records or race conditions between steps.

**Solution:** The flow has **three simple steps**: (1) list **guides who are free** for the event and dates; (2) **preview** — check the request again and return **price breakdown** for the screen before payment; (3) **save the booking** only when the traveler confirms. The server **checks availability again** on preview and on save, so an outdated pick from an earlier screen cannot become a real booking by mistake.

---

### 3. Multi-Date Guide Availability Conflict Detection

**Challenge:** When a traveler books a guide, they may select multiple dates at once. The system must guarantee that the chosen guide is fully available across *every* selected date — not just some of them. A guide who is booked on even one of those dates must not appear as available.

**Solution:** The availability check works at the database query level by counting how many of the requested dates conflict with the guide's existing bookings. Only guides with zero conflicts across all selected dates are returned as available. This prevents partial-availability issues before they reach the application layer.

**Performance & scalability:** Composite **database indexes** on **guide** and **date** fields keep those lookups cheap as bookings and calendar rows grow—so the feature stays responsive under heavier load instead of degrading into full table scans.

---

### 4. Bulk Firebase Notifications (Rate Limits, Delays & Jobs)

**Challenge:** Sending push notifications to a large audience from the admin panel can hit **FCM quotas**, **HTTP timeouts**, and **unreliable partial delivery** if the server tries to send synchronously in one request. Retries can also **duplicate** messages without careful design.

**Solution:** Treat bulk sends as **asynchronous work**: enqueue **dedicated queue jobs** (e.g. **one job per user/token batch**) instead of sending inside the web request. Between sends, apply a controlled **delay/backoff** so traffic stays under FCM limits and workers stay healthy. Optionally group tokens into **FCM multicast chunks** where the API allows, while still keeping **per-user failure isolation** and **retry**  in the queue layer.
